## Introduction ##

The project will be focused on Scrabble for Polish language. As for now it's not planned to make it configurable thus all language-specific stuff might be hardcoded deeply in the source code.

<font color='#FF0000'><b>At the moment project is in early alpha phase. Do not expect fully working solution!</b></font> You can only press OK and watch how hardcoded words are added to the board and player's score is updated - see [Hardcoded Words](http://code.google.com/p/pl-scrabble-like-java/source/browse/trunk/Scrabble/src/pl/webd/jhartman/scrabble/gui/ScrabbleGUI.java#155)

However, all the communication (including class/method/variable/etc names as well as source comments will be retained in English).

Project has been started as my way to learn Java. It's my first software written in Java so I'm counting for your understanding for all my faults and mistakes.

Application should run smoothly on all operation systems with JRE-1.4+ (Tested on Mac OS, Linux and Windows)

As recently I've owned Samsung Galaxy S II phone I'm planning to port this app to Android. When? Maybe one day :)
