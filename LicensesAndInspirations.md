# 3rd party licenses and inspirations #

## Lit ##

My application was inspired by **Lit - program do gry w literaki** (_"Lit - an application to play Literaki /Scrabble-clone/"_) Original application has been developed for Windows and can be downloaded at http://marek01.pop.e-wro.pl/lit/

Lit is available under GPL license.

## SJP.pl dictionary ##

Of course, each Scrabble application needs a dictionary. I'm using SJP.pl's dictionary available at http://www.sjp.pl/slownik/growy/

SJP.pl's dictionary is available under GPL and CC SA licenses.

## Eclipse ##

Software was developed using Eclipse for Mac OS.

## JSmooth ##

Windows executable has been created using JSmooth http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/

## Image resources ##

This is going to be more developing class and I'm not an art creator I hope that colleagues from http://code.google.com/p/javaprojscrabble/ will not complain if I use their graphics:
